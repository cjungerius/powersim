    "text": "In this notebook we’ll go through a quick example of setting up a power analysis, using data from an existing, highly-powered study to make credible parameter estimates. The code for setting up a simulation is inspired by/shamelessly stolen from a great tutorial about this topic by Lisa DeBruine and her appendix on its application for sensitivity analysis\nBefore we do anything, let’s import all the packages we will need:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) # Data wrangling, plotting and general awesomeness\nlibrary(lmerTest) # Mixed modeling using lme4 with better support for tests\nlibrary(broom.mixed) # To make pretty tables\nlibrary(knitr) # To print those pretty tables\n\nIn this example, we will make an estimate of the number of participants we need to replicate a simple and well-established experimental finding: The capture of attention by a colour singleton during visual search for a unique shape singleton. For this example, we are fortunate in that there are many studies of this effect for us to base our parameter estimates on. One recent example is a highly-powered study from the Serences lab purpose-built to be used for sensitivity analysis. First let’s import the data for our specific case from the Adam et al. (2021) study, which is freely available in an OSF repository, and look at the data.\nNote that when previous data doesn’t exist (or even if it does, but you don’t trust that it’s sufficient to base your effect estimates on) there are alternative ways of determining such parameters, including formally determining a smallest effect size of interest.\nThe data we chose is from experiment 1c: variable colour singleton search. We are interested in the raw trial data, not the summary data (We are doing a mixed model after all, not an ANOVA) so we have to grab all the raw files and concatenate them.\n\ndf <- list.files(\n  path = \"./Experiment_1c\",\n  full.names = T) %>% \n  lapply(\n    read_csv,\n    col_types = cols(\n      gender = \"c\",\n      set_size = \"f\"\n    )\n  ) %>% \n  bind_rows\n\nOnce it’s imported, we can take a look at our data, e.g., looking at subject means between the two conditions:\n\ndf %>% \n  filter(acc == 1,\n         set_size == 4) %>% \n  mutate( rt = rt*1000) %>% \n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x=distractor,\n      y=rt,\n      color=as.factor(subject),\n      group=as.factor(subject)\n    )) +\n  guides(color = \"none\") +\n  stat_summary(\n    fun.data = \"mean_se\",\n    size=1\n    ) +\n  theme_bw()+\n  ggtitle(\"Reaction time by participant\")+\n  xlab(\"Colour singleton\")+\n  ylab(\"Reaction time (ms)\")+\n  theme(text=element_text(size=20))\n\n\n\n\nWe can clearly see typical atttentional capture effects in the data. Now that we have the data, let’s model it:\n\nd <- df %>% \n  filter(acc == 1,\n         set_size == 4) %>% \n  mutate( rt = rt*1000)\n\n# Our model is simple: RT is dependent on distractor presence, with a random slope and intercept for each subject.

Now for a power analysis, we’d put the above in functions and run the code many times for a given combination of parameters. See below:\n\nmy_sim_data <- function(\n  \n  n_subj     = 5,   # number of subjects\n  n_present  = 200,   # number of distractor present trials\n  n_absent   = 200,   # number of distractor absent\n  beta_0     = 650,   # grand mean\n  beta_1     = 30,   # effect of category\n  tau_0      = 80,   # by-subject random intercept sd\n  tau_1      = 15,   # by-subject random slope sd\n  rho        = 0.35,   # correlation between intercept and slope\n  sigma      = 175\n  )\n  {\n\n# simulate a sample of items\n# total number of items = n_ingroup + n_outgroup\nitems <- data.frame(\n  item_id = seq_len(n_present + n_absent),\n  category = rep(c(\"distractor_present\", \"distractor_absent\"), c(n_present, n_absent))\n)\n\n# effect-code category\nitems$X_i <- recode(items$category, \"distractor_absent\" = -0.5, \"distractor_present\" = +0.5)\n\n# simulate a sample of subjects\n\n# calculate random intercept / random slope covariance\ncovar <- rho * tau_0 * tau_1\n\n# put values into variance-covariance matrix\ncov_mx  <- matrix(\n  c(tau_0^2, covar,\n    covar,   tau_1^2),\n  nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)\n\n# generate the by-subject random effects\nsubject_rfx <- MASS::mvrnorm(n = n_subj,\n                             mu = c(T_0s = 0, T_1s = 0),\n                             Sigma = cov_mx)\n\n# combine with subject IDs\nsubjects <- data.frame(subj_id = seq_len(n_subj),\n                       subject_rfx)\n\n# cross subject and item IDs; add an error term\n# nrow(.) is the number of rows in the table\ntrials <- crossing(subjects, items)  %>%\n  mutate(e_si = rnorm(nrow(.), mean = 0, sd = sigma)) %>%\n  select(subj_id, item_id, category, X_i, everything())\n\n# calculate the response variable\ndat_sim <- trials %>%\n  mutate(RT = beta_0 + T_0s + (beta_1 + T_1s) * X_i + e_si) %>%\n  select(subj_id, item_id, category, X_i, RT)\n}\n\nThe above function simulates data. The function below combines it with a model fit so we have a function that can be repeatedly called during our power analysis.\n\nsingle_run <- function(filename = NULL, ...) {\n  # ... is a shortcut that forwards any arguments to my_sim_data()\n  dat_sim <- my_sim_data(...)\n  \n  # run lmer and capture any warnings\n  ww <- \"\"\n  suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(\n    mod_sim <- withCallingHandlers({\n      lmer(RT ~ X_i + (1 + X_i | subj_id),\n           dat_sim, REML = FALSE)},\n      warning = function(w) { ww <<- w$message }\n    )\n  ))\n  \n  # get results table and add rep number and any warnings\n  sim_results <- broom.mixed::tidy(mod_sim) %>%\n    mutate(warnings = ww)\n  \n  # add columns for the specified parameters\n  params <- list(...)\n  for (name in names(params)) {\n    sim_results[name] <- params[name]\n  }\n  \n  # append the results to a file if filename is set\n  if (!is.null(filename)) {\n    append <- file.exists(filename) # append if the file exists\n    write_csv(sim_results, filename, append = append)\n  }\n  \n  sim_results\n}\n\nNow let’s run our sensitivity analysis - we will run our simulation 1000 times for each combination of parameters, and record how often the fixed effect estimates reach significance:\n\nnreps <- 1000\n\nparams <- crossing(\n  rep        = 1:nreps, # number of runs\n  n_subj     = 10, # number of subjects\n  n_present  = 150,   # number of distractor present trials\n  n_absent   = 150,   # number of distractor absent\n  beta_0     = 650,   # grand mean\n  beta_1     = 30,   # effect of category\n  tau_0      = 80,   # by-subject random intercept sd\n  tau_1      = 15,   # by-subject random slope sd\n  rho        = 0.35,   # correlation between intercept and slope\n  sigma      = 175  # residual (standard deviation)\n) %>%\n  select(-rep)\n  \nsims <- purrr::pmap_df(params,single_run,filename=NULL)\n\n# calculate mean estimates and power for specified alpha\nalpha <- 0.05\nsims %>% \n  filter(effect == \"fixed\") %>%\n  group_by(term) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_estimate = mean(estimate),\n    mean_se = mean(std.error),\n    power = mean(p.value < alpha),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 2 x 4\n  term        mean_estimate mean_se power\n  <chr>               <dbl>   <dbl> <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)         651.    23.3  1    \n2 X_i                  29.9    7.75 0.937\n\n\nIf we want to run our sensitivity analysis across a given parameter space, we’ll have to map the function single_run to generate data across this space, for example, over a varying number of participants:\n\nfilename1 <- \"sens1.csv\"\nnreps <- 1000 # number of replications per parameter combo\n\nparams <- crossing(\n  rep        = 1:nreps, # repeats each combo nreps times\n  n_subj     = seq(2, 15), # number of subjects\n  n_present  = 150,   # number of distractor present trials\n  n_absent   = 150,   # number of distractor absent\n  beta_0     = 650,   # grand mean\n  beta_1     = 30,   # effect of category\n  tau_0      = 80,   # by-subject random intercept sd\n  tau_1      = 15,   # by-subject random slope sd\n  rho        = 0.35,   # correlation between intercept and slope\n  sigma      = 175  # residual (standard deviation)\n) %>%\n  select(-rep)\n\nif (!file.exists(filename1)) {\n  # run a simulation for each row of params\n  # and save to a file on each rep\n  sims1 <- purrr::pmap_df(params, single_run, filename = filename1)\n}\n\nNote that the above could obviously also be run over other dimensions of our parameter space, e.g. for different estimates of the fixed effects, amount of noise, number of trials, etc. etc., by changing the params list. How did we do? Let’s take a look at our power curve.\n\n# read saved simulation data\n# NB: col_types is set for warnings in case \n#     the first 1000 rows don't have any\nct <- cols(warnings = col_character(),\n           # makes sure plots display in this order\n           group = col_factor(ordered = TRUE),\n           term = col_factor(ordered = TRUE))\nsims1 <- read_csv(filename1, col_types = ct)\n\npower1 <- sims1 %>% \n  filter(effect == \"fixed\", term == \"X_i\") %>%\n  group_by(n_subj) %>%\n  summarise(\n    mean_estimate = mean(estimate),\n    mean_se = mean(std.error),\n    power = mean(p.value < alpha),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) \n\npower1 %>%\n  ggplot(aes(n_subj, power)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +\n  ylim(0, 1) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0.8,linetype=\"dashed\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(name = \"Effect of number of participants\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Power for designs varying in sample size\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nOur power analysis has determined that, with the parameters established above, we need ~8 or more participants to reliably detect an effect!\nThe code used above is specific to power analysis for mixed models, but the approach generalises to other methods too, of course! The above code can easily be wrangled to handle different model types (simply change the model definition in single_run and make sure to capture the right parameters), and even Bayesian approaches. (For a thorough example of doing power analysis with Bayesian methods and the awesome bayesian regression package brms, see this blog post).\nEven if the above code is spaghetti to you (~I was originally planning on also converting it to python/matlab, but there are only so many hours in the day~click here for a python version), I hope you will take away a few things from this tutorial:\n\nPower analysis is nothing more than testing whether we can recover the parameters of a hypothesised data-generating process reliably using our statistical test of choice.\nWe can determine the parameters for such a data-generating process in the same way we formulate hypotheses (and indeed, in some ways these two things are one and the same): we use our knowledge, intuition, and previous work to inform our decision-making.\nIf you have a hypothetical data-generating process, you can simulate data by simply formalising that process as code and letting it simulate a dataset\nSimulation can help you answer questions about your statistical approach that are difficult to answer with other tools"

Now for a power analysis, we’d put the above in functions and run the code many times for a given combination of parameters.

The function below combines it with a model fit so we have a function that can be repeatedly called during our power analysis.\n\ndef single_run(filename = None, *args, **kwargs):\n  dat_sim = my_sim_data(*args, **kwargs)\n  with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as w:\n    warnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\")\n    md = smf.mixedlm(\"RT ~ category\", dat_sim, groups=dat_sim['subj_id'], re_formula=\"~category\")\n    mod_sim = md.fit()\n  sim_results = (mod_sim\n    .summary()\n    .tables[1]\n    .assign(**kwargs))\n  sim_results = sim_results.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce')\n  sim_results.index.rename('i',inplace=True)\n\n  if not filename == None:\n    hdr = not os.path.isfile(filename)\n    sim_results.to_csv(filename, mode='a',header=hdr)\n  \n  return sim_results\n\nNow let’s run our sensitivity analysis - we will run our simulation many times (100 times here for speed, but aim for more, like 1000+) for each combination of parameters, and record how often the fixed effect estimates reach significance:\n\nnreps = 100\n\nparams = ParameterGrid({\n  'n_subj'     : [5], # number of subjects\n  'n_present'  : [150],   # number of distractor present trials\n  'n_absent'   : [150],   # number of distractor absent\n  'beta_0'     : [650],   # grand mean\n  'beta_1'     : [30],   # effect of category\n  'tau_0'      : [80],   # by-subject random intercept sd\n  'tau_1'      : [15],   # by-subject random slope sd\n  'rho'        : [0.35],   # correlation between intercept and slope\n  'sigma'      : [175]  # residual (standard deviation)\n})\n\nsims = pd.concat([single_run(**param) for param in params for i in range(nreps)])\n\n\n  \nalpha = 0.05\n\n(sims\n  .assign(power = sims['P>|z|'] < alpha)\n  .query('i==\"Intercept\" or i==\"category[T.present]\"')\n  .groupby(['i'])\n  .agg(\n      mean_estimate = ('Coef.','mean'),\n      mean_se = ('Coef.', 'sem'),\n      power = ('power', 'mean')))\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      mean_estimate\n      mean_se\n      power\n    \n    \n      i\n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Intercept\n      633.27521\n      3.172399\n      1.00\n    \n    \n      category[T.present]\n      29.84433\n      1.120568\n      0.69\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nIf we want to run our sensitivity analysis across a given parameter space, we’ll have to map the function single_run to generate data across this space, for example, over a varying number of participants:\n\nfilename1 = \"sens_py.csv\"\nnreps = 100\n\nparams = ParameterGrid({\n  'n_subj'     : range(2,10), # number of subjects\n  'n_present'  : [150],   # number of distractor present trials\n  'n_absent'   : [150],   # number of distractor absent\n  'beta_0'     : [650],   # grand mean\n  'beta_1'     : [30],   # effect of category\n  'tau_0'      : [80],   # by-subject random intercept sd\n  'tau_1'      : [15],   # by-subject random slope sd\n  'rho'        : [0.35],   # correlation between intercept and slope\n  'sigma'      : [175]  # residual (standard deviation)\n})\n\n\n\nif not os.path.isfile(filename1):\n  # run a simulation for each row of params\n  # and save to a file on each rep\n  sims1 = pd.concat([single_run(**param, filename=filename1) for param in params for i in range(nreps)])\n\nNote that the above could obviously also be run over other dimensions of our parameter space, e.g. for different estimates of the fixed effects, amount of noise, number of trials, etc. etc., by changing the params list. How did we do? Let’s take a look at our power curve.\n\nsims1 = pd.read_csv('sens_py.csv')\n\npower1 = (sims1.assign(power = sims1['P>|z|'] < alpha)\n  .query('i==\"category[T.present]\"')\\\n  .groupby(['n_subj'])\\\n  .agg(\n    mean_estimate = ('Coef.','mean'),\n    mean_se = ('Coef.', 'sem'),\n    power = ('power', 'mean')))\n\n\nsns.regplot(x=power1.index, y=power1[\"power\"],lowess=True)\n\n<AxesSubplot:xlabel='n_subj', ylabel='power'>\n\n\n\n\n\nOur power analysis suggests that, with the parameters established above, we need ~8 or more participants to reliably detect an effect!\nThe code used above is specific to power analysis for mixed models, but the approach generalises to other methods too, of course! The above code can easily be wrangled to handle different model types (simply change the model definition in single_run and make sure to capture the right parameters), and even Bayesian approaches. (For a thorough example of doing power analysis with Bayesian methods and the awesome bayesian regression package brms, see this blog post).\nEven if the above code is spaghetti to you (Perhaps you prefer R?), I hope you will take away a few things from this tutorial:\n\nPower analysis is nothing more than testing whether we can recover the parameters of a hypothesised data-generating process reliably using our statistical test of choice.\nWe can determine the parameters for such a data-generating process in the same way we formulate hypotheses (and indeed, in some ways these two things are one and the same): we use our knowledge, intuition, and previous work to inform our decision-making.\nIf you have a hypothetical data-generating process, you can simulate data by simply formalising that process as code and letting it simulate a dataset\nSimulation can help you answer questions about your statistical approach that are difficult to answer with other tools"
